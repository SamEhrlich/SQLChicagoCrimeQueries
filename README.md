# SQLChicagoCrimeQueries
In this notebook, I import a csv file into pandas. I clean the data and import the data into a sql server. I then query the data for useful related to crime in Chicago.
The cells with SQL are copies of code moved over from my terminal. The code does not run in the cell, but is an example of what it looks like when I run the queries in SQL.
